Image Data Preprocessing Toolkit

What can Pixel.py be used for?
--------------------------------

Motivation to create another API for image data processing
----------------------------------------------------------
In the course of writing my bachelor thesis, I encountered many problems when processing image datasets. These were mostly incomplete libraries that did not cover my need. For this reason I decided to develop my own library and put it for public use.
